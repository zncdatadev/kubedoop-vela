# Kubedoop Secret Operator

This is a Kubernetes Operator to provision and inject secrets for Kubernetes pods. Compared to Kubernetes' native secret mounts, this permits secrets to be selected dynamically based on properties of the Pod.

It's part of the kubedoop Data Platform, a modular open source data platform built on Kubernetes that provides Kubernetes native deployment
and management of popular open source data apps like Apache Kafka, Apache Doris, Apache Kyuubi, Trino or Apache Spark, all working
together seamlessly. Based on Kubernetes, it runs everywhere â€“ on prem or in the cloud.
