# Kubedoop Commons Operator

Operator for common objects of the Kubedoop Data Platform(KDP). This operator is required for most installations of the Kubedoop and some things might not work if you do not install it.

It's part of the kubedoop Data Platform, a modular open source data platform built on Kubernetes that provides Kubernetes native deployment
and management of popular open source data apps like Apache Kafka, Apache Doris, Apache Kyuubi, Trino or Apache Spark, all working
together seamlessly. Based on Kubernetes, it runs everywhere â€“ on prem or in the cloud.
